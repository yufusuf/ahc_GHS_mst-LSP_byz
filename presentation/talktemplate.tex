\section{The Problem}
%\begin{frame}
%        \sectionpage
%\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The problem}
\begin{block}{Minimum Spanning Tree in distributed systems} 
The primary problem addressed by the GHS algorithm is the efficient construction of a minimum spanning tree within
a connected, undirected graph. This entails determining the optimal set of edges that connect all vertices of the graph
while minimizing the total edge weight. This algorithm is essentialy the distributed version of the Kruskal’s minimum spanning tree algorithm.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The problem}
\begin{block}{Byzantine Fault} 
The primary problem tackled by the LSP broadcast algorithm is the components within a system may fail in unpredictable ways, leading to inconsistencies in system behavior and communication. The difficulty lies in achieving consensus among the system’s components, even when some of them are faulty or malicious. The Byzantine fault problem is not only theoretically intriguing but also practically significant.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\section{The Contribution}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What is the solution/contribution}
\framesubtitle{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Detailed implementation of the algorithms on the AHCv2 platform.
\item Performance evaluation of the algorithms across diverse network topologies and usage scenarios
\item Comparative analysis of the algorithms with previous approaches, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and key
insights
.\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\section{Motivation/Importance}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Motivation/Importance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Solving the problem of constructing a minimum spanning tree is crucial for network management and communication
efficiency in distributed systems. 
    \item By efficiently establishing optimal connectivity, the GHS algorithm enables better resource-utilization.
    \item Example: Failure to find optimal broadcasting can lead to suboptimal network configurations, increased resource overhead, and diminished system efficiency.
\end{itemize}

% \frametitle{Model, Definitions}
% \framesubtitle{Formal definition of a Stochastic Process}
% The use of terminology and jargon should be kept to a minimum, but is impossible to avoid entirely. All terms must be introduced early. It is also useful to remind the audience of the definitions at critical points later in the talk.
%
% Background and this slide can be combined....

%
% \subsection{Background, Previous Works}
% \begin{frame}{Background}
% Research is not usually carried out in a vacuum. There will almost always be other relevant or related work, which you should describe. Present an orderly synopsis of these previously- obtained results. A table is often used for this purpose. Be sure to mention the author of each paper and its date of publication. \textbf{Compare and contrast them with each other and with your paper.}

% \section{Contribution}
% \subsection{Main Point 1}
% \begin{frame}{Main Point 1: A Figure}
% \framesubtitle{Abstract the Major Results}
% Describe the key results of the paper. You may present the statements of the major theorems, but not their proofs. You will probably have to get a little technical here, but do so gradually and carefully.

% \begin{frame}
% \frametitle{Main Point 2}
% \framesubtitle{Explain the Significance of the Results}
% Pause, and explain the relationships between the formal theorems that you have just presented and the informal description that you gave in the Introduction. Make it clear to the audience that the results do live up to the advance publicity. If the statements of the theorems are very technical then this may take some time. It is time well-spent.
%
% \end{frame}
%
% \subsection{Main Point 3}
% \begin{frame}
% \frametitle{Main Point 3}
% \framesubtitle{Sketch a Proof of the Crucial Results}
% The emphasis is on the word ``sketch''. Give a very high-level description of the proofs, emphasizing the proof structure and the proof techniques used. If the proofs have no structure (in which case it may be assumed that you are not the author of the paper), then you must impose one on them. Gloss over the technical details. It is a good idea to point them out but not to explore them.

%
% \section{Experimental results/Proofs}
%
% \subsection{Main Result 1}
% \begin{frame}
% \frametitle{Main Result 1}
% \framesubtitle{}
% Choose \textbf{just the key results}. They should be important, non-trivial, should give the flavour of the rest of the technical details and should be presentable in a relatively short period of time. Use figures instead of tables instead of text.
%
% Better to present 10\% the entire audience gets than 90\% nobody gets

%
%
% \subsection{Main Result 2}
% \begin{frame}
% \frametitle{Main Result 2}
% \framesubtitle{Try a subtitle}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Make sure your notation is clear and consistent throughout the talk. Prepare a slide that explains the notation in detail, in case that is needed or if somebody asks.
% \item Always label all of your axes on graphs; use short but helpful captions on figures and tables. It is also very useful to have an arrow on the side which clearly shows which direction is considered better (e.g., "up is better").
% \item If you have experimental results, make sure you clearly present the experimental paradigm you used, and the details of your methods, including the number of trials, the specific analysis tools you applied, significance testing, etc.
% \item The talk should contain at least a brief discussion of the limitations and weaknesses of the presented approach or results, in addition to their strengths. This, however, should be done in an objective manner -- don't enthusiastically put down your own work.
% \end{itemize}
% \end{frame}
%
%
% \subsection{Main Result 3}
% \begin{frame}
% \frametitle{Main Result 3}
% \framesubtitle{}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item If time allows, the results should be compared to the most related work in the field. You should at least prepare one slide with a summary of the related work, even if you do not get a chance to discuss it. This will be helpful if someone asks about it, and will demonstrate your mastery of the material.
% \item Spell check again.
% \item Give for each of the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis
% \item Label, unit, scale (if log scale)
% \item Give the legend
% \item Explain all symbols
% \item Take an example to illustrate a specific point in the figure

% \section{Conclusions}
% \begin{frame}
% \frametitle{Conclusions}
% \framesubtitle{Hindsight is Clearer than Foresight}
% Advices come from \cite{spillman2000present}.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item You can now make observations that would have been confusing if they were introduced earlier. Use this opportunity to refer to statements that you have made in the previous three sections and weave them into a coherent synopsis. You will regain the attention of the non- experts, who probably didn’t follow all of the Technicalities section. Leave them feeling that they have learned something nonetheless.
% \item Give Open Problems It is traditional to end with a list of open problems that arise from your paper. Mention weaknesses of your paper, possible generalizations, and indications of whether they will be fruitful or not. This way you may defuse antagonistic questions during question time.
% \item Indicate that your Talk is Over
% An acceptable way to do this is to say “Thank-you. Are there any questions?”\cite{einstein}

% \begin{itemize}

% \item The Body:    Abstract the Major Results, Explain the Significance of the Results, Sketch a Proof of the Crucial Results
% \item Technicalities: Present a Key Lemma, Present it Carefully
% \item The Conclusion: Hindsight is Clearer than Foresight, Give Open Problems, Indicate that your Talk is Over
