Conclusion
==========

In conclusion, the implementation and evaluation of the Gallager-Humblet-Spira (GHS) algorithm for constructing minimum spanning trees (MSTs) in simulated ad hoc networks have yielded significant insights and outcomes.

Through the execution of the GHS algorithm across different network topologies, including fully connected and random graphs, we have demonstrated its effectiveness in efficiently determining MSTs. The algorithm's performance was particularly notable in scenarios where nodes are densely interconnected, although convergence times were observed to increase in fully connected networks due to heightened message exchange.

Moreover, our study validated the theoretical predictions concerning message complexity associated with the GHS algorithm, affirming its computational accuracy and reliability.

These results collectively highlight the GHS algorithm's practical applicability and robustness for MST construction within distributed systems. Future work could explore optimizations and adaptations of the algorithm to enhance its scalability and performance in larger-scale network environments, or how the algorithm should behave when faulty nodes are present. Overall, the GHS algorithm stands as a valuable tool for addressing minimum spanning tree challenges in diverse network settings.
